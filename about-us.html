                                    <li>Shoes Me may have started in 2020, but the idea to create such site was
                                    planned all the way back to 2010 and with the help of studying coding, it was made possible.
                                    </li> <br/>
                                    <li>Shoes Me was originally called, What Are Those?, as a reference to a famous vine video back 
                                    in 2015 but decided not to reuse original content and make up our own.
                                    </li> <br/>
                                    <li>Drake was the first celebrity to mention Shoes Me in his socials and hence the suddent tick in user counts.
                                    Talk about timing and huge thanks to Drake himself for discovering us.
